Hook functions with EasyHook

# inspiration
I got inspiration for this project while I was playing around with teamspeak's overlay Overwolf and I saw the EasyHook.dll and I thought (as a hacker) you might be able to use this just like how you can call MinHook functions from DiscordHook64.dll, this is not perfect and a little write-up on in 40~ minutes.
